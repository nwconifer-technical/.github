# NWConifer Technical

I'm a rogue agent operating unsanctioned on behalf of the Nationstates region [New West Conifer](https://www.nationstates.net/region=new_west_conifer).

## Who are we?
The "we" is doing a lot of heavy lifting considering at writing this is one person, [Gallaton](https://www.nationstates.net/nation=gallaton), but as the repo(s) are public, anyone's welcome to contribute ~~though of course every PR must be approved by myself~~. This is anyone interested in software engineering with some relation to the Nationstates region [New West Conifer](https://www.nationstates.net/region=new_west_conifer), if that's you please do scroll through the existing repos and, if you feel you can, open a PR.

## What's being worked on just now?
_We_ are currently working on a NS stock market thing at https://finance.nwconifer.net and it's relevant API https://api.finance.nwconifer.net. The system is still in very early development, with currently a log in and cash system "existing" but very buggy. If you have thoughts or would like to help contribute, either open up a PR or shoot Gallaton a TG/Discord message.
